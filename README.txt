# July 7 2022
# This repo will be actively worked on from now.
# This file will be my ToDo list of things to take care of

- have the ckan-docker repo for the "get CKAN up on Docker" repo
- create a new repo (maybe 'ckan-docker-dev') for a Dev orientated approach
- get rid of the "patches/" stuff like in OKFN
- Get rid of 2.8 and 2.7. We should only support Docker on CKAN 2.9 (or latest stable which will soon be 2.10)
- Get rid of nginx, just provide instructions on how to add it
- Use pre-built CKAN base images, eventually move them over to an official CKAN DockerHub repo with the correct tags
- No extensions but provide instructions on how to add to a Dockerfile
- no hard-coded container names, use environment variables
